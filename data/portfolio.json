For the hobby projects you’ll find on my GitHub, I primarily use Python. Throughout my professional experience I have mostly used C# and worked on the backend, with occasional help in JS and React for the frontend. In my post-secondary I able to briefly touch on all the most common programming languages, and learn the latest professional practices.\n\nI would like to honour and recognize the unceded territory of the Coast Salish peoples upon I live.\n","resume":{"tagline":"","description":"","experiences":[{"id":"1","dates":"May 2021 - Present","type":"","position":"Junior Developer at Orveto Technologies","bullets":" Performed full-stack development for a web app that processes business property expenses.
